Mosh .Net MCV Tutorial Code

This project was based on the .Net MCV Tutorial Code by Mosh @ codewithmosh.com

I highly recommend this course if you want to learn this topic! I has helped me immensly!
The course is a little dated and you will need to figure out fixes to make it work in 2021+, but that is the point right?
